## What is GraphQL
 - A query language for APIs
 - A specification, not a library or language
 - Developed by Facebook, and widely-adopted

## Why Should You Use GraphQL?
 - GraphQL APIs have strongly typed schemas
 - Rapid product development
 - An efficient alternative to REST
    - No more over or under fetching
